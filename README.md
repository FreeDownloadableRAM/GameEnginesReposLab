Designed the platformer level to be a beginner type stage. The enmies arent meant to kill the player but just act as a small obstacle to get in the player's way.
They are there to teachthe player that they reset their jump state, so that you can use them to jump off of them to reach higher heights.

The controls are WASD and SPACE to jump,
To complete the level you make your way to the top of the level and enter a door.
